### What is this repository for? ###

A starting template for new solr projects that wants to use tellusr.

### How do I get set up? ###

Change the folder name of `configset/default` to the core name you wish.
You may copy the folder recursively to new names if you need more cores.

Run `bin/ttb` to start solr on with your config. Use CTRL+D to exit. The
setup is rebuilt every time to restart.

You can add code for migrating test data in `tellusr.env`. Here you can also
override configuration variables.
